Things left to be done:

 - Finding a soultion for deleting threaded comments
   When a comment is deleted now, its childen remain orphaned
   (they can be seen by using a "flat" template, though)

 - Make a switch in Admin Panel to allow/deny users to delete or
   modify their own comments

 - find bugs ;-)

 - Additional feature requests can be submitted to the project page
   at https://github.com/zikula-modules/EZComments/
