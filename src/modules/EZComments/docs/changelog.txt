v1.6  -  Feb 2009
Florian Schieﬂl (aka quan)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     - New parameter "useurl" can be passed as parameter whenever the hook
       is called. This parameter might be important for
       some modules who have a different redirect url where the user
       should be redirected after adding a comment and another url that
       should be used in the email notification (Important for the
       UserPictures module for example. The "redirect" url can pass
       a different picture for loggen in and anonymous users depending
       on the privacy settings of a picture).
     - New database structure. Added field "owneruid". You can
       specify a new parameter "owneruid" whenever you integrate
       EZComments. EZComments will store this value as "content
       owner" and allow this user to moderate all comments for
       his content.
     - Added ContactList support. If a user is ignored by another
       user he cannot comment the other user's content any more.
     - Added MyProfile plugin
     - Added icon for user account panel: manage my comments
     - deleted all comment templates and added one new called "Standard"
     - added stylesheet and language file support for own comment templates
     - added time in hours how long users are able to edit their own comments

       Migration plugin functionality
       Available now is a plugin to migrate from the original NS-Comments
       Module to EZComments

       Cleanup functionality to erase
       This is needed after the deletion of a module. EZComments does not
       recognize this deletion. With the Cleanup you can wipe out all comments
       for the module in question.

       Comments can be displayed threaded (depending on the template)

       Comments can have their own subject (depending on the template)

       Templates uses .htm as suffix
       Templates uses <!--[ and ]--> as smarty delimiters
       Added a lot of Templates in the MoreTemplates directory

       Added a pager to the admin panel so you do not see all comments on
       one page (important for sites with lot of comments)

       Transform hooks
       EZComments calls transform hooks. The hooks must be activated for
       the "parent" module (say, you want EZComments for News, so you must
       activete the transform hooks for News, not for EZComments)

       A lot of new translation variables.
